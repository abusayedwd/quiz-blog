                        <br> map> executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.  <br> filter > checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.   <br> >> and the find method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold"> Question-2: What is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage, session and cookies?</h2>
                <h2 class="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-700 font-semibold"> <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Answer:</span> Local and session storage are JavaScript APIs that you can use to store data on the client-side. They allow a website to store data on the browser and instruct the browser to access it later on.
                     <br>   Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared when the user closes its browser window.

                <h2 class="text-lg mt-3 text-gray-700 font-semibold"> <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Answer:</span> Event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism through which the 'calls waiting for execution' in the callback queue/job queue can be put on the call stack. For any event from the callback queue/job queue to come to call stack, the call stack will have to be empty.
